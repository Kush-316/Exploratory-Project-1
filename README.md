# Exploratory Project

This was our project in 2nd year of college in which we integrated web development with the principles of machine learning.
Our project consisted of 3 parts :

We created and deployed machine learning models for the following diseases or infections - 

1 . Detection of Covid-19 with the help of chest CT scans.

2 . Predection of brain tumour with the use of brain CT scans.

3 . Detection of pneumonia with the help of chest X-ray images.

## Stress - Strain

We built a ML model which would predict the suitable values of a,b and n which would fit the graph of experimental data of stress-strain values of different materials. 

The graph of the plastic region would follow the function a+bx^(n). Hence our model would give the most apt values to fit the data. Also it would predict the errors between the analytical and experimental results.
## Roads and Traffic

We used the yolo v3 architecture to identify objects in an image and provide their locations, sizes and classes in real time. 

Alongwith we did road segmentation on a given video for the autonomous vehicles to know where they can drive. We used Fully Convolutional Networks for this task
